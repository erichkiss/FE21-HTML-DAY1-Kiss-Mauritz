        <p>This is how it looks when every line is a div </p>
        <div>She packed my bags last night pre-flight</div>
        <div>Zero hour 9:00 a.m.</div>
        <div>And I'm gonna be high</div>

        I miss the Earth so much I miss my wife
        It's lonely out in space
        On such a timeless flight
        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
        I'm not the man they think I am at home

        'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
        I'm not the man they think I am at home

        I'm a rocket man
        Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
        Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
        In fact it's cold as hell
        And there's no one there to raise them
        If you did
        And all this science
        I don't understand
        It's just my job five days a week
        A rocket man
        A rocket man
        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
        I'm not the man they think I am at home
        Oh, no, no, no

        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
